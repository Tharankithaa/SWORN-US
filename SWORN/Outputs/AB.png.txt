Abstract

The word translation has several meanings such as change, paraphrase, rendering, rewording,
transformation, transcription, interpretation, decoding and so on. However, it simply, defines
as the process of turning a source language into a target language. The aim of this study is to
explore the obstacles that translators encounter when translating proverbs and to explore the
strategies that translators apply when translating proverbs from Sinhala to Tamil vice versa.
To enhance the goal the researcher selected 20 2" year translation studies undergraduates in
Department of Translation Studies, University of Jaffna. The researcher selected 10 Tamil
proverbs and 10 Sinhala proverbs. The students were asked to translate Sinhala ones into
Tamil and Tamil ones into Sinhala.

The study revealed that the obstacles which undergraduates face when translating proverbs
from Sinhala to Tamil and vice versa. The students unable to translate proverbs from source
language to target language because of their inability, they mostly provide wrong target
language equivalent, irrelevant meaning and wrong paraphrasing, using literal translation and
misuse of the appropriate lexical words, committing linguistic, stylistic and grammatical
mismatches and unfamiliarity with translation strategies and techniques. Further, this study
recommends investigating the structure and style of Sinhala proverbs in comparison with
Tamil in the data analysis part.

Key words: - obstacles, proverbs, strategies, techniques, translation,
